loop through the board
use value iteration for each red piece

    This matrix will hold objects for each state and their actions. 
    Each slot holds a probability, reward, the next state, and if the next state holds a terminal state

    this will loop through the board and find the agent's pieces and store them in a list.
    this list will represent our number of states
